# weatherapi
I learnt nodeJS and implemented my knowledge to develop a real-time website that tells about the current weather at Lucknow using nodeJS by fetching the data from API and using that data on my website  as well as I used HTML and CSS for frontend and javaScript for changing the HTML elements whenever the temperature and weather changes..
